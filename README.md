# HomeLab-Documentation
Repository for my HomeLab project documentation.

## Why i started this project?
It all started when I remembered that I had my old computer lying around, and I figured I could put it to good use. So I did, and I think this could be a good resume or portfolio project where I can host my own web portfolio to showcase all the projects I've ever done.
